# SQL-Case-Study-of-a-Major-Travel-Company

**Data Analyst SQL Case Study of a Major Travel Company.

In this project, I utilized SQL to analyze a dataset containing user bookings for flights and hotels.

I answered several questions related to user behavior, such as identifying users whose first booking was a hotel and calculating the time between a user's first and last booking.

Additionally, I analyzed the data by year and month to count the number of bookings for each category. Throughout the project, I documented my approach and created a data dictionary as well.


I have attached the SQL queries along with their output

Questions that were answered:
1. Write an SQL query that gives below output.(Summary at segment level)
2. Write a query to identify users whose first booking was a hotel booking.
3. Write a query to calculate the days between first and last booking of each user.
4. Write a query to count the number of flights and hotel bookings in each of the users by the year 2022.
